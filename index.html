	<p>Everyone knows what an elephant is.  Most children in kindergarten are taught about this mammal.  Schools teach that they are
	the largest animal on Earth.  In addition to that, they are herbivores, which means that they only consume plant matter.  Because of their 
	dietary habits, they are about to survive in various locations.  There are two different kinds of elephants in the world: Asian and African.  While these two relative species
	are very similar, they do have distinct differences that set them apart.  
	</p></div>
	<div STYLE= "text-align: center; background-color: white">
	<p>The two different types of elephants have distinct characteristics other than just their regoinal location.  The Asian elephant is relatively smaller in size than the African elephant by 
approximately 300 lbs.  While both the male and female African elephants grow tusks, only the males develop tusks for the Asian elephants.    
	</p></div>
	<div STYLE= "text-align: center; background-color: white">
	<p>Every day they are hunted mercileslly by poachers for their ivory tusks.  Instead of trying to humanly sedate the animal to remove the tusks, hunters more often than not kill the creater.
		Elephants have made it onto the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) endangered list.
		Since 1992, National Geographic has been promoting research on Elephant conservation.  Now that you know all of these cool facts 
		about elephants, help keep them around!  You can use the link at the bottom on this page to see how to help.
